## Introduction

`my-react-app` is a simple React application built for educational purposes. It serves as a starting point for beginners to learn about React, project setup, and package management using `npm` and `yarn`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- yarn (optional, but recommended)

You can check your Node.js and npm versions by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

To install `yarn`, run:

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

### Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ajay-dhangar/my-react-app.git
cd my-react-app
```

2. Install dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install
```

### Running the App

To start the development server, you can use either `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# Using yarn
yarn start
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure:

```
my-react-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ExampleComponent.js
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── yarn.lock
```

- `public/`: Contains the public assets and the HTML file.
- `src/`: Contains the React components, main application file, and other JavaScript files.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in the Git repository.
- `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- `yarn.lock`: Lock file for dependencies when using `yarn`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start` / `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` / `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` / `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back! If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
